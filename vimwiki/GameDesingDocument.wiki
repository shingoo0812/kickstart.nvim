= Game Design Document Outline =

A game design document is the blueprint from which a game is to be built. 
As such, every single detail necessary to build the game should be addressed. 
The larger the team and the longer the design and development cycle, the more critical is the need.
For your purpose, the intent is to capture as much as possible of your design. 
I want you to think big…bigger than what you are able to develop. I also want you to be clear about what the software delivers and what the design entails.
My recommendation is that you define the ultimate game and then clarify what it is that you have developed.
All topics must be included, but “not applicable” is fine. The goal is NOT to force you to make up answers, but to assure that you have considered all of these elements and why they are or are not relevant to your game.
Your document must include the top levels of the outline explicitly. You should use your judgment as to how to present the additional detail, particularly when it is not relevant to your game. I don’t need a page of “not applicable.”
