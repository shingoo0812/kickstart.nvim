= Purpose =
This Example is destroy the mobs when they leave the screen.
To do so, we' ll connect our VisibleOnScreenNotfier3D node's screen_exited signal to the Mob.

= Node Composition =
    Mob(CharacterBody3D)
    |_ Pivot(Node)
    |   |_ Character(Node3D) *3d data
    |_ CollisionShape3D
    |_ VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D
    
= Setting Signal =
Select the VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D node and on the right side of the interface, navigate to the Node dock. Double-click the screen_exited() signal.

Connect the signal to the Mob

This will add a new function for you in your mob script
_on_visible_on_screen_notifier_3d_screen_exited(). From it, call the queue_free() method. This function destroys the instance it's called on.
