= 1.Setting to Inspector =
If you use Node that have Collision Shape.They are StaticBody, KinematicBody2D, RigidBody2D so on.
You can setting to Collision Layer directly in Inspector.

= 2.Setting in a Script =
You can also set the collison layer using a script:
```$YourCollisionNode.collision_layer = 0b10 # Setting to the second layer```

= 3.Setting to Flag in Code =
You can add collision that use the specified flags.
```@export_flags_2d_physics var collision_layer : int = 0b10000```

= 4.Setting to Collision Layer Name in Project Settings =
You can assign names to collision layers in the Project Settings under Layer Names -> 2D Physics or 3D Physics.
This makes it easier to manage and identify layers.

= 5.CustomCollision =
