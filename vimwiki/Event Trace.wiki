<Event Tace>
If you don't know where in your code the event was triggered, do the following:


1. Use Debug.Log() to view stack traces.
    ```Debug.Log("Toggle called from: " + new System.Diagnostics.StackTrace().ToString());```

2. Search for the method name in your code to see where it's being called.
3. If it's being called by a UI event or a trigger event, check the event listener settings.
4. Use Unit's Profiler or Memory Profiler to visualize the runtime flow.
